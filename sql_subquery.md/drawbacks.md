Performance Issues: Subqueries can be less efficient compared to joins, especially for large datasets, as they might require multiple executions for correlated subqueries.
Complexity: Subqueries can make the query harder to read, maintain, and debug, particularly if nested deeply.
Limited Functionality: In some databases, subqueries cannot be used in certain clauses (like SELECT or ORDER BY) or might not support all operations.
Scalability: Subqueries may not scale well with large datasets or complex queries, leading to slower response times.
Optimization Limitations: Some database engines may struggle to optimize subqueries, especially correlated ones, compared to equivalent joins.
Readability Issues: As subqueries grow in complexity, they can become harder to understand compared to using joins or common table expressions (CTEs).
