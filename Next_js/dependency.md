Dev Dependencies (devDependencies)
These are the packages that are only needed during development, not in production.
They include tools like testing frameworks, linters, build tools, or transpilers that help you develop the project but are not required in the final application code.
These are not bundled when the project is deployed to production.


Dependencies (dependencies)
These are the essential packages required for your project to run in production.
They include libraries or frameworks your application depends on when it is running live.
When you install a package as a dependency, it gets included in the final build of your application.
